🧠 Project: chaodumbao $DUMBAO

😵‍💫 Theme:
A chaotic, minimalistic memecoin site celebrating the dumbest, most meme-worthy dogs the internet has to offer. Think stretched eyeballs, lopsided tongues, and cursed intelligence. Brutally funny and ultra-minimalist. No deep lore, no whitepapers — just stupid dogs and dumber holders.

🧱 Structure:

1. **Header**
- Logo (logo.jpg)
- Site name: "chaodumbao"
- Ticker: $DUMBAO
- Buttons: "Buy on Pump.fun", "Twitter", "Read the Dumbplan"

2. **Hero Section**
- Fullscreen banner image (banner.jpg)
- Large heading: "The dumbest dogs. The smartest buy."
- Subheading: “You’re not early. You’re just confused.”
- One button: “Buy $DUMBAO”

3. **Why $DUMBAO?**
- 3 dumb facts (with emoji icons)
    - 🧠 IQ < 20
    - 💰 No Utility. Just Bite.
    - 🐶 Born to Bark, not to Think.

4. **Gallery of Dumb**
- Use uploaded images (1.jpg–8.jpg)
- Each dog image gets a block with a short, chaotic caption:
    - “Sniffed glue once, never recovered.”
    - “Thinks doorbells are government surveillance.”
    - “Barks at air.”
    - “Used to be smart. Then he met DeFi.”
    - “Shat in a ledger once.”
    - “CEO of ‘accidentally rugged’.”
    - “IQ test came back… blank.”
    - “Holds $DUMBAO like a deity.”

5. **The Dumbplan**
- Text block (unfolds on button click):
  - “There is no roadmap. We sniff, we bark, we pump. If this goes 100x, it’s not because we planned it. It’s because dumb wins.”
  - “Phase 1: Accidentally launch”
  - “Phase 2: Dogs buy dogs”
  - “Phase 3: Floor becomes religious”

6. **CTA Footer**
- Buttons again: “Buy $DUMBAO”, “Tweet Something Stupid”
- Legal disclaimer: “$DUMBAO is not responsible for sudden brain loss.”

🎨 Design:
- Minimal layout, white/cream background
- Text: monospace, Comic Neue or similar
- Dog captions in oversized font
- Hover animation: tilt/wobble
- All sections bounce slightly as they appear

📦 Assets to use:
- logo.jpg

📌 Notes:
